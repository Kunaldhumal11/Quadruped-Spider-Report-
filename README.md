# Quadruped-Spider-Report

Arduino nano board, Nano IO Expansion Shield, and twelve SG 90 servo motors are used for the spider robot. Two 18650 li-ion batteries are used to provide power. An ultrasonic sensor is used to set Obstacle Avoiding and a Bluetooth module is used to control Bluetooth. An Android app is used to control the spider robot using Bluetooth. This Spider robot can be made into three types by changing the Arduino codes and modules.
